# Current Plan and Status
[2024-05-04] Task: Modify banned word handling
- ✅ Create CheckAndCleanBanned method in TaskService
- ✅ Create CheckAndCleanBanned method in BannedPromptUtils
- ✅ Update ITaskService interface 
- ✅ Update controllers to use CheckAndCleanBanned
- Task completed: Modified the system to remove banned words instead of throwing exceptions

[2024-05-04] Task: Add AI review functionality for prompts
- ✅ Create IPromptReviewService interface
- ✅ Create GPTPromptReviewService implementation
- ✅ Add EnableAIReview config to ProxyProperties
- ✅ Register service in ServiceCollectionExtensions
- ✅ Implement AI review in Imagine, Shorten and Modal methods
- Task completed: Added AI content review for user prompts

[2024-05-06] Task: Improve AI review handling for URLs and parameters
- ✅ Update AI review in Imagine method to separate URLs and parameters
- ✅ Add AI review with URL and parameter separation to Shorten method
- ✅ Add AI review with URL and parameter separation to Modal method
- Task completed: Enhanced AI review to only process text content while preserving URLs and parameters

# Learned Knowledge
## Technical Knowledge
[2024-05-04] When dealing with banned words in prompts, removing them instead of blocking the entire prompt can improve user experience while still maintaining content moderation.
[2024-05-04] AI review services can be integrated with translation services to provide additional content moderation capabilities.
[2024-05-06] When processing text with AI services, it's important to separate and preserve special elements like URLs and parameters to avoid modifying them incorrectly.
[2024-05-06] The same text extraction pattern can be reused across different processing functions (translation, banned word checking, AI review) to ensure consistent handling.

## Project Patterns
[2024-05-04] The Midjourney-proxy project uses both a TaskService class and a BannedPromptUtils static class for banned word handling, so both needed to be updated.
[2024-05-04] Services are registered in ServiceCollectionExtensions and can be injected into controllers.
[2024-05-04] Configuration options are added to ProxyProperties class and accessed through GlobalConfiguration.Setting.
[2024-05-06] Text processing in this project follows a pattern of: extracting parameters → extracting URLs → processing text content → recombining all parts.

## Error Corrections
[2024-05-04] Fixed the banned word handling to remove banned words instead of throwing exceptions.
[2024-05-06] Fixed AI review processing to avoid modifying URLs and parameters which could break functionality.

# Project Guidelines
[2024-05-04] For content moderation:
- Prefer to clean content when possible instead of rejecting it entirely
- Maintain both service class and utility class implementations in sync
- Use AI services to enhance content moderation beyond simple word filtering 
[2024-05-06] For text processing:
- Always separate URLs and parameters before processing text content
- Process only the actual text content with AI/NLP services
- Preserve original formatting of specialized content (URLs, parameters)
- Apply consistent processing patterns across similar functions
